                Amazing Kids Christian Child Care & Pre-school is Washington State licensed and encourages children to grow and learn.  We do this by giving the individual care our students need and deserve. Our desire is to meet  each one of our students where they are and help them grow and learn. 
                his is accomplished through group learning, age appropriate play & pre-academic experiences which are provided daily. The children love learning their ABCâ€™s &  phonics as well as early childhood math. We provide a positive child centered program that encourages children to learn and love learning.     
                To help children understand the love and care we receive from  God, we use the Bible, songs and story telling to teach Christian lessons. Our students are encouraged, respected, and lovingly taught social and cognitive skills through the personal guidance of the teachers. We use a variety of age appropriate learning tools, including games, music, physical activities, creative art, dramatic play, promoting socialization and problem solving abilities.      We serve nutritious & well balanced meals in keeping with state guidelines. This helps the children learn good eating habits early in life.   
                Our outdoor play yard is completely enclosed and secure so your kids can have a safe, fun place to run and play.
