                <p>Your babies are so important to us. Every day we work with them on feeling loved with a strong sense of security, babies blossom in our care.  During this age children will explore their world, learning language, body movements, social interactions,  and bonding with love and trust. The children feel safe, secure and loved when we cuddle and hold them. We love playing and  encouraging them to experience new things and grow. Children this age love to play games that interact with their care giver like peek-a-boo/ pat-a-cake/ listening to music and exploring objects.</p>
