                <p>Our wonderful curious preschoolers are ready to learn. Group time is awesome. We love to sing,  dance, play group games, read our Bible stories, and learn lessons on a weekly theme. Books are so exciting. Hearing books read is important. Patterning,  shapes, color and math games are also fun. We also love art and exploring art materials. Art develops muscles in the fingers and creativity in our thinking and helps us in the learning process. We provide sensory play and gross and fine motor development. Our make believe is cooperative and often a very social activity.</p>
